%   [SPIKE_SHAPES, SPIKE] = EXTRACT_SPIKE(TIME, DATA, DDATA, THRESHOLD, WIDTH, TPRE, TPOST, FLAG)
%
%     Version 2.0 - threshold-crossing triggered extraction of the peaks shape; no 'delaying' included.
%
%     Extract details on the occurrence time, the amplitude, the upward and downward speed and the peak shapes of a peak-train
%     by iterating a simple peak detection algorithm, based on (positive derivative) threshold-crossing.
%
%  *  The input argument  TIME refers to the data time column [s] and it is used for many internal operations and to extract the peak-times.
%  *  The input arguments DATA is the raw data trace [mV], while DDATA is the raw data trace to be used for detecting threshold-crossings.
%     In most of the situations DDATA is the time derivative of DATA (i.e. [mV/s], DDATA = diff(DATA,1)/dt, where dt = TIME(2)-TIME(1)). However it
%     can be DDATA = DATA or DDATA = zDATA, with zDATA a different raw data trace sharing the same length of DATA and TIME.
%  *  The input argument THRESHOLD, specified in the units of DDATA, is the (positive derivative) peak-event-detection threshold (e.g. 1.5E5 mV/s).
%  *  The input argument WIDTH is the minimal distance between two successive peak-events and it is assumed to be measured in [ms] (e.g. 2 ms).
%  *  The input arguments Tpre and Tpost specify, in [ms], the observation window to retrieve the shape of the detected spike.
%  *  The input argument FLAG specifies whether the detected spike shape to be put on SPIKE_SHAPES must be aligned according to the
%      threshold-crossing time (FLAG == 1), or alternatively to the time of the spike peak (FLAG == 0).
%
%  *  The output argument SPIKE_SHAPES is a cell array, containing the shape of each individual spike over a window specified by Tpre and Tpost.
%
%  *  The output argument SPIKE is a (N x 4) numeric array, containing respectively:
%                       - the absolute time of occurrence of the detected peak [s] (extracted from the corresponding element in TIME)
%                       - the amplitude of the peak [mV]                           (extracted from DATA)
%                       - the maximal upstroke slope of the peak [mV/s].           (extracted from the time derivative of DATA)
%                       - the maximal downstroke slope of the peak [mV/s].         (extracted from the time derivative of DATA)
